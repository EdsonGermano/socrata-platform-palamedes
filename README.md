Palamedes
=========

We often need to count things. But you know, counting things can be
hard, especially when the things that you need to count are arriving
from different threads than other similar things.  This attempts to solve this
for rolling window counts, maybe not exactly, but close enough.
Palamedes is said to have invented counting as well as wine making.
If the counts are off, blame the wine.
